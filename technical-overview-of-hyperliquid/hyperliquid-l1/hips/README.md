# HIPs

### **What are HIPs?**

**Hyperliquid Improvement Proposals (HIPs)** are initiatives designed to enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the Hyperliquid L1 blockchain and its ecosystem.&#x20;

Each HIP outlines a specific improvement, offering a transparent and standardized process for introducing new features or standards into the protocol.&#x20;

🚧 _I’m still working to fully understand how HIPs are structured and evolve, including their governance, naming conventions, and processes. However, the general idea is that HIPs—like Ethereum’s EIPs—help guide the development of key protocol-level changes._

**At this time, two primary HIPs have been implemented:**

* **HIP-1:** Establishes a native token standard on the Hyperliquid L1, similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum-based networks.
* **HIP-2:** Introduces Hyperliquidity, a built-in, on-chain liquidity provisioning mechanism designed to bootstrap and maintain efficient markets for newly deployed tokens.

_It’s possible that more HIPs will emerge as the ecosystem matures, each addressing new challenges and opportunities within Hyperliquid._
