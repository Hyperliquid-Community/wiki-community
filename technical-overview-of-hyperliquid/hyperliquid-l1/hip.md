# HIPs

### **What are HIPs?**

**Hyperliquid Improvement Proposals (HIPs)** are initiatives designed to enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the Hyperliquid L1 blockchain and its ecosystem.&#x20;

Each HIP outlines a specific improvement, offering a transparent and standardized process for introducing new features or standards into the protocol.&#x20;

ðŸš§ _Iâ€™m still working to fully understand how HIPs are structured and evolve, including their governance, naming conventions, and processes. However, the general idea is that HIPsâ€”like Ethereumâ€™s EIPsâ€”help guide the development of key protocol-level changes._

**At this time, two primary HIPs have been implemented:**

* **HIP-1:** Establishes a native token standard on the Hyperliquid L1, similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum-based networks.
* **HIP-2:** Introduces Hyperliquidity, a built-in, on-chain liquidity provisioning mechanism designed to bootstrap and maintain efficient markets for newly deployed tokens.

_Itâ€™s possible that more HIPs will emerge as the ecosystem matures, each addressing new challenges and opportunities within Hyperliquid._
