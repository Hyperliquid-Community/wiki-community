# Spot Deployments

## **How to Deploy Tokens on Hyperliquid**

There is only **one official method** to deploy a new token on Hyperliquid: a **Dutch Auction** that occurs every **31 hours**.

* **One ticker** is created at each auction interval.
* You must pay the required **gas cost** (Auction price) to win and **receive** the right to deploy your token.
* **Auction tracking:** [ASXN Auction Dashboard](https://data.asxn.xyz/dashboard/hl-auctions) - View all past and current auctions

_**Note:**_ HyperEVM enables builders to link ERC-20 tokens with spot tokens. However, without a native Hyperliquid ticker acquired via Dutch Auction, your token wonâ€™t appear on the front end or be traded on the order book.

***

### **1.** Official Deployment Interface

* Access the **official deployment interface** here: [https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/deploySpot](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/deploySpot).
* For a more **comprehensive understanding** of the deployment process (or to launch your token), we recommend reading: [Spot Deployments (HIP-1, HIP-2)](../../architecture/hypercore/hips/spot-deployments-hip-1-hip-2.md).

### 2. Crowdfunding with Hpump

[**Loracle** ](https://x.com/laurentzeimes)offers a **pre-market** approach that integrates seamlessly with the Dutch Auction:

* **Traders** can trade an **unlimited number** of tokens before theyâ€™re officially listed.
* **Token creators** can rely on **automatic ticker purchase** once the tokenâ€™s **TVL** meets the **auction price**â€”securing their tokenâ€™s listing on Hyperliquid.
