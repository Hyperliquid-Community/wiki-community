# Airdrop

### 1. Why Farm HL

* **Successful History:**
  * Two previous point seasons have led to the largest airdrops, proving that active participation pays off.
* **Constant Buying Pressure:**
  * The Assurance Fund reinvests a portion of platform fees to continuously purchase HYPE, ensuring steady demand.
* **Robust Tokenomics:**
  * **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 HYPE tokens
  * **Already Distributed:** 31% (310M tokens) in the genesis event
  * **Reserved for Core Contributors:** 23.8% (238M tokens)
  * **Remaining for Future Emissions & Community Rewards:** 45.2% (approximately 452M tokens)
  * **Market Potential:** At a $10 token price, the remaining tokens represent roughly **$4.52 billion** in potential value.
* **Staking Advantage:**
  * The introduction of staking is a major progression—by staking HYPE, you reduce trading fees while earning additional rewards. See the [Fees page](../../architecture/hypercore/dex/clearinghouse/fees.md) for more details.
* **Multiple Revenue Streams:**
  * Farming HL not only earns you direct rewards but also opens up opportunities across various protocols within the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

### 2. How to Farm HL

Our guide is built thanks to X posts, and in particular this one: [HyperEVM Airdrop Playbook 102](https://x.com/ellie_nfts/status/1907048635990421540) by @ellie\_nfts. For in-depth details, please refer to his guide. Below is an overview of farming strategies split into two main areas: HyperCore and HyperEVM.

#### A. HyperCore

* **Season 1 & 2 Rewards:**
  * Rewards were based on your trading volume on **perpetuals** and holding **spot** tokens.
  * Points are retroactive, so actions taken now (trading, staking, HLP) may still earn rewards.
* **Potential Reward Areas:**
  * **Trading:** Engaging in perp trades is likely to be rewarded.
  * **Spot Holdings:** Maintaining a spot token balance on the platform can earn you points.
  * **Staking:** Staking your $HYPE reduces fees and could yield additional rewards.
  * **HLP Contributions:** Depositing into the HLP pool helps keep the DEX operational and is expected to be incentivized.

#### B. HyperEVM

* **Setup & Participation:**
  * Create your HL account, deposit funds (e.g., send USDC), buy $HYPE, and transfer your funds to HyperEVM following the provided instructions.
* **Engagement & Rewards:**
  * Perform on-chain actions and interact with various HyperEVM protocols.
  * Trading activities and protocol interactions on HyperEVM are expected to be rewarded with HL.
  * Participation in HyperEVM not only earns rewards on this chain but also unlocks farming opportunities across the broader HL ecosystem.
