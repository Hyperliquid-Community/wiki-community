# Airdrop

### 1. Why Farm HL

* **Proven Track Record:**
  * Two previous point seasons delivered the largest airdrops in DeFi history, proving that active participation generates substantial rewards
* **Continuous Buying Pressure:**
  * The [Assurance Fund](../../architecture/hypercore/vault.md#id-2.-protocol-vaults-assistance-fund-af) automatically reinvests **93% of platform fees** to purchase HYPE tokens, creating consistent demand and price support.
* [Strategic Tokenomics](../../architecture/hyperbft/staking.md#tokenomics)
* **Staking Advantage:**
  * Staking HYPE reduces your trading fees while earning 2.2% annual rewards, a dual benefit that compounds your returns. See the [Fees page](../../architecture/hypercore/dex/clearinghouse/fees-builder-codes.md) for more details.
* **Multiple Revenue Streams:**
  * HL farming provides direct rewards and unlocks opportunities across the entire Hyperliquid ecosystem, multiplying your earning potential.

### 2. How to Farm HL

Below is an overview of farming strategies split into two main areas: HyperCore and HyperEVM.

#### A. HyperCore

* **Season 1 & 2 Rewards:**
  * Rewards were based on your trading volume on **perpetuals** and holding **spot** tokens.
  * Points are retroactive, so actions taken now (trading, staking, HLP) may still earn rewards.
* **Potential Reward Areas:**
  * **Trading:** Engaging in perp trades is likely to be rewarded.
  * **Spot Holdings:** Maintaining a spot token balance on the platform can earn you points.
  * **Staking:** Staking your $HYPE reduces fees and could yield additional rewards.
    * [Top validators](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/staking) include @nansen\_ai x @hypurr\_co, Alphaticks, Validao, Hypio x HyperBeat, and ASXN.
  * **HLP Contributions:** Depositing into the HLP vault helps keep the DEX operational and is expected to be incentivized.

#### B. HyperEVM

* **Setup & Participation:**
  * Create your HL account, deposit funds (e.g., send USDC), buy $HYPE, and transfer your funds to HyperEVM following the provided instructions.
* **Engagement & Rewards:**
  * Perform on-chain actions and interact with various HyperEVM protocols.
  * Trading activities and protocol interactions on HyperEVM are expected to be rewarded with HL.
  * Participation in HyperEVM not only earns rewards on this chain but also unlocks farming opportunities across the broader HL ecosystem.
*   **Strategy Examples:** There are many possible strategies to explore. You can start by:

    * Using [HyperUnit](https://app.hyperunit.xyz/) to deposit and collateralize your BTC or other assets in [Felix](https://usefelix.xyz/), [HyperLend](https://app.hyperlend.finance/dashboard), or [HypurrFi](https://app.hypurr.fi/points)
    * Using [HyperSwap](https://app.hyperswap.exchange/) or [Laminar](https://x.com/laminar_xyz) to provide liquidity
    * You can find the complete list of all protocols on HyperEVM on this [page](../../ecosystem/projects/).
