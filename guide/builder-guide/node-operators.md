# Node Operators

_**Note:** This page is under active construction, and the information here may evolve as we learn more. Please check back for updates._

**Validators** play a crucial role in the Hyperliquid network by validating transactions, producing blocks, and securing the blockchain. Their performance can vary based on factors like **uptime**, the **quality and frequency of block proposals**, and adherence to network rules (i.e., avoiding **slashing events**). As the network matures, validators and node operators will have more tools, metrics, and best practices at their disposal.

**Non-Validating Nodes** help by providing additional services such as accessing data, supporting EVM functionality, or contributing to the network’s overall resilience without participating directly in block production.

#### Resources

**Stay Updated:** Check pinned messages in the <kbd>#node-operators</kbd> Discord channel for the latest instructions and updates. If you have **questions**, that’s the best place to ask!
