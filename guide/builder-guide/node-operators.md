# Node Operators

#### Validators

Validators play a **crucial role** in the Hyperliquid network by:

* Validating transactions
* Producing blocks
* Securing the blockchain

Validator performance can vary based on factors like:

* **Uptime** and reliability
* Quality and frequency of **block proposals**
* Adherence to network rules (avoiding slashing events)

As the network matures, validators and node operators will have more tools, metrics, and best practices at their disposal.

#### Non-Validating Nodes

Non-validating nodes help the network by providing additional services:

* Accessing and serving data
* Supporting **EVM functionality**
* Contributing to network resilience without participating in block production

#### Resources

* **HyperBFT** – To understand more about staking, validators, and consensus mechanism, see the [HyperBFT](../../architecture/hyperbft/) page
* **Github Node Repository** – You can run a node by following the non-validator and validator setup steps in the [repository](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node).
* **Official Documentation**: – For detailed technical specifications, visit the [Node Setup section](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/nodes).
