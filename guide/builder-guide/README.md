# Builder Guide

HyperFoundation is on a mission to make Hyperliquid the **“Amazon Web Services of liquidity”**—a neutral backend that empowers anyone to build innovative financial applications without worrying about the heavy lifting. By offering robust, plug-and-play infrastructure, Hyperliquid lets you focus on creating value and delivering top-notch products.

#### A World of Possibilities

The current flagship application on Hyperliquid is the **DEX developed by Hyper Labs**, but that’s only one example of what’s possible. Whether you’re envisioning new trading tools, risk management platforms, or entirely novel financial products, **Hyperliquid’s infrastructure is yours to explore**. This is the essence of **Open Finance**: building, iterating, and launching whatever you can imagine—free from the usual constraints of traditional finance or single-purpose blockchains.

#### Three Core Components of Hyperliquid

1. **L1 Perp & L1 Spot:**
   * These are the foundational markets of Hyperliquid, accessible via **API endpoints**.
   * Instead of interacting directly with the RPC, users interact with **permissionless API servers**, which relay requests to the network’s consensus RPC. This design ensures **better load balancing, DDoS protection, and a familiar experience**, similar to cex.
2. **HyperEVM:**
   * A **standard EVM** environment with added features that grant access to **L1 primitives**.
   * Development feels familiar (e.g., using RPC calls and typical EVM tooling), but you also benefit from enhanced functionalities unique to Hyperliquid.
3. **Node Operators:**
   * Anyone can **run a node** and participate in network consensus, helping secure the network.
   * This open participation model underpins the decentralization of Hyperliquid and ensures its long-term resilience.

#### Your Invitation to Build

With the resources in this Builder Guide, you’ll have everything you need to **create, innovate, and deploy** your own applications on Hyperliquid.
