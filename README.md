# ‚ò∫Ô∏è Welcome!

Welcome to the Wiki of the Hyperliquid Community

***

### üöß **This site is currently under construction!** üöß

We are actively working on building the documentation to provide you with step-by-step tutorials, guides, and resources to help you make the most out of Hyperliquid.

***

This site is designed to facilitate knowledge sharing among builders, traders and investors using the **Hyperliquid** platform, a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX).

The articles are organized into categories, visible in the sidebar on the left. However, the easiest way to find answers to your questions is by using the **search tool** in the top-right corner of the page.

If you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for, feel free to connect with the **Hyperliquid Community** on forums or social media for support and discussions. For official issues or technical concerns, please reach out to **Hyperliquid‚Äôs support team** directly through their platform.
