# Fees

Hyperliquid’s fee system is designed to reward active traders, referral users, and the broader community. By leveraging volume-based discounts, staking and referral incentives, the platform ensures that participation benefits users while funding the ecosystem’s development.

### Key Highlights

* **Volume-Based Benefits (VIP Tiers):** Traders enjoy discounts based on their rolling 14-day volume and can earn referral rewards to reduce costs.
* **Rebates for Market Makers:** Continuous maker rebates are paid directly to trading wallets.
* **Updated Structure (Stacking Tiers):** Effective April 30, 2025, staking tiers will be introduced and separate fee schedules will apply for perpetuals (perps) and spot markets—with spot volume counting double.
* **Community-First Approach:** All fees are funneled back into the community through the HLP program and the Assistance Fund.

Please note:

* **Sub-Accounts:** Volume from sub-accounts counts toward the master account’s fee tier; all sub-accounts share the same tier.
* **Vault Volume:** Vault transactions are treated separately from the master account.
* **Referral Discounts:** Both referral discounts and referral rewards apply only to your first $25M in volume.

Maker rebates are issued continuously on each trade directly to the trading wallet, and users can claim referral rewards from the Referrals page.

### Fee Tiers 📊

#### VIP + Staking Tiers

**General Fee Calculation:**\
Fees are based on your rolling 14-day volume, combining both perps and spot volumes—with spot volume counting double. In other words:

> **14d weighted volume = (14d perps volume) + 2 × (14d spot volume)**

**Perps Fee Tiers**

| Tier      | 14d Weighted Volume ($) | Taker Fee | Maker Fee |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Base Rate |                         | 0.045%    | 0.015%    |
