# Fees

Hyperliquid’s fee system is designed to reward active traders, referral users, and the broader community. By leveraging volume-based discounts and referral incentives, the platform ensures that participation benefits users while funding the ecosystem’s development.

***

### **Fee Tiers** 📊

Hyperliquid employs a **VIP tier system** and **Market Maker tiers** to calculate taker and maker fees based on trading volume. Fees are dynamically adjusted based on the last **14 days of volume**, ensuring fairness and scalability for all traders.

Market makers benefit from lower fees through the **Market Maker tier system** (see chart above). Hyperliquid offers no special programs or rebates—**anyone can participate**. Tools and support: [Python SDK](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk) | [#api-traders Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperliquid).

### **Referral Program** 🎁

Hyperliquid incentivizes user growth with its robust referral program, enabling traders to earn rewards by inviting others to the platform.

#### **How to Refer**

* Create your referral code on [Hyperliquid Referrals](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals) after completing **$10,000 in trading volume**.

#### **Referral Rewards**

  * The **HLP (Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider)** program.
  * The **Assistance Fund**, which protects and stabilizes the ecosystem.
