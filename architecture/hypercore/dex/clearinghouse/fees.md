**Please note:**

* **Volume Calculation:** Fees based on rolling 14-day weighted volume: `(14d perps volume) + 2 × (14d spot volume)`
  * **Spot volume counts double** toward fee tier calculation
* **Sub-Accounts:** Volume from sub-accounts counts toward master account's fee tier; all sub-accounts share the same tier
* **Vault Volume:** Vault transactions treated separately from master account
* **Referral Limits:**
  * Referral discounts apply for first $25M in volume
  * Referral rewards apply for first $1B in volume
  * Discounts don't apply to vaults or sub-accounts
* **Builder Codes:** Staking referral program also applies to builder codes (more info on this [page](../../../../guide/builder-guide/hypercore/)). Builders receive builder fee + up to 40% of HL fees and can share up to 50% of these fees with users
* **Fee Assessment:** Calculated at end of each day in UTC

***

### **Fee Distribution & Sources**

On Hyperliquid, **fees are entirely directed to the community** through HLP, the Assistance Fund, and spot/perp deployers rather than being extracted by the protocol team.

**Current Fee Allocation:**

* **7% of fees** → HLP vault
* **93% of fees** → Assistance Fund
* **Fee Tracking:** Direct fee visibility is limited - estimates based on trading volume. Analytics: [HyperDash](https://hyperdash.info/statistics) | [HypurrScan](https://hypurrscan.io/dashboard)

**Fee Sources:**

* **Perpetual trading:**
  * **Hyperliquid Labs perps:** All fees go to protocol
  * **HIP-3 perps:** Up to 50% of fees go to deployer, remainder to protocol
* **Spot trading:**
  * **USDC side (bid):** Fees go to protocol
  * **Token side (ask):** Deployer controls what percentage of fees they collect (0-100%)
    * If 100% → All fees go to deployer's address
    * If 0% → All fees are burned
    * Deployers can only decrease their share permanently
    * Tokens deployed before January 2025 have all fees burned (including [HYPE](https://data.asxn.xyz/dashboard/hype-burn))
    * To check a token's fee share: Call API `spotMetaAndAssetCtxs` → `deployerTradingFeeShare`
* **Spot deployment:** [Auction fees](../../hips/spot-deployments-hip-1-hip-2.md#what-is-hip-1) paid by deployers to purchase tickers
* **Future:** HyperEVM fees may be distributed to HYPE stakers

#### Market Maker Tiers

Market makers benefit from lower fees through a dedicated tier system that rewards high liquidity providers. Hyperliquid offers no special programs or rebates, **anyone can participate**. Tools and support: [Python SDK](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk) | [#api-traders Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperliquid).

| Tier | 14d Weighted Maker Volume | Maker Fee Rebate |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |

### Referral Program

#### Standard Referral Program

**How to Refer:**

* Complete $10,000 in trading volume to create your referral code at [Hyperliquid Referrals](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals)
* Share your unique link: `https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/YOURCODE`

**Benefits:**

* **Referrers Earn:** 10% of referred users' fees (for first $1B volume)
* **Referred Users Get:** 4% fee discount (for first $25M volume)

#### Staking Referral Program

_Coming soon_ - The staking referral program allows builders and referrers who stake HYPE to earn enhanced rewards based on the **difference between their staking tier discount and their referred user's discount**.

**Key Mechanism:**

* If a referrer has a higher staking tier than their referred user, they can keep a percentage of the staking discount difference
* The percentage kept decreases as the referred user's VIP tier increases (higher VIP = lower earnings for referrer)

| VIP Tier | 14d Weighted Volume ($) | Amount Kept by Referrer |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **0**    |                         | 100%                    |
| **1**    | >5M                     | 90%                     |
| **2**    | >25M                    | 80%                     |
| **3**    | >100M                   | 70%                     |
| **4**    | >500M                   | 60%                     |
| **5**    | >2B                     | 50%                     |
| **6**    | >7B                     | 40%                     |

**Example:** Alice stakes 100K HYPE (Platinum tier = 30% discount) and refers Bob who stakes 100 HYPE (Bronze tier = 10% discount). Bob is VIP 1 (90% rate).

* **Staking discount difference:** 30% - 10% = 20%
* **Alice keeps:** 20% × 90% = 18% of Bob's fees
* **Alice can share back:** Up to 50% of her 18% = 9% discount for Bob
* **Result:** Bob gets up to 9% additional discount using Alice's referral code
