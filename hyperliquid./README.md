# Hyperliquid.

This section explores the companies that are actively **building for Hyperliquid** - those contributing essential components that enhance the core platform functionality, as distinct from those building applications on Hyperliquid.

The **permissionless nature of blockchain** allows anyone to add features and improvements to the ecosystem. This open architecture represents why CEXs will be replaced - they served their purpose for a time, but their era is coming to an end. This reflects a broader principle of open-source development that has the potential to transform our world.

The first entity to add building blocks to Hyperliquid was **Hyperunit** ([February 14, 2025](https://x.com/chameleon_jeff/status/1890443240186462684)), which we'll detail in the following section.
