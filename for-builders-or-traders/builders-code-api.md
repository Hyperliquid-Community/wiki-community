# Builders‚Äô Code (API)

üöß _**This section is currently under construction.**_

This page is dedicated to exploring how to use **APIs** to create custom interfaces, enabling users to interact with HyperLiquid while incurring **additional fees** for using these interfaces.

The objective is to provide a clear guide on the **implementation process** and **fee structures**, enhanced with **visual examples** for better understanding.

For more details, refer to the official documentation:

* [Builder Codes Documentation](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/builder-codes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **To stay informed, please refer to the messages in the `#api-traders` Discord channel.** You‚Äôll find the most current instructions, updates, and community-driven resources there.
