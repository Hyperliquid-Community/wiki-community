# About the Team Behind Hyperliquid Labs

**Hyperliquid Labs** is the **key contributor** powering the platform’s growth. Led by **Jeff Yan** and **iliensinc** (both Harvard alumni), the team also includes talent from **Caltech** and **MIT**. They have also worked at Airtable, Citadel, Hudson River Trading and Nuro.

#### What Makes Them Different?

* **Self-Funded & Community-Oriented:** No VC funding. Most fees and value are returned to the **community** (via HLP and other incentives).
* **Born from Crisis:** In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, Hyperliquid was envisioned in 2022 to offer a **trustless, on-chain alternative**. They quickly realized the potential to go beyond replacing DEXs—why not transform **all of finance**?
* **Long-Term Commitment:** The team’s goal is to **empower builders and users**, offering rewards and pushing the boundaries of on-chain finance.
