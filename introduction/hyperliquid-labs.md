# Hyperliquid Labs

**Hyperliquid Labs** is the key contributor driving the platform's growth. The team is composed of talented individuals from prestigious institutions like **Harvard**, **Caltech**, and **MIT**, with professional experience at **Airtable**, **Citadel**, **Hudson River Trading**, and **Nuro**.

#### **What Makes Them Different?**

* **Self-Funded & Community-Oriented:** No VC funding. All fees and value are returned to the **community** (via HLP and other incentives).
* **Born from Crisis:** In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, Hyperliquid was envisioned in 2022 to offer a **trustless, on-chain alternative**. They quickly realized the potential to go beyond replacing DEXs—why not transform **all of finance**?
* **Long-Term Commitment:** The team’s goal is to **empower builders and users**, offering rewards and pushing the boundaries of on-chain finance.
