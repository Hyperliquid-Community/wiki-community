# MemeCoin

Dive into the trenches of the HyperLiquid ecosystem with memecoins and tokens that drive community engagement.

### The HyperEVM Memecoin Phenomenon

Hyperliquid's memecoin scene is emerging as a unique ecosystem with characteristics that differentiate it from other blockchain environments:

#### Community-First Culture

Unlike many other chains where memecoins quickly rise and fall, Hyperliquid has developed a more supportive community culture:

* **Hypios as a Movement** - The "Hypio" community identity has become a cultural touchpoint, similar to how "Solana Degens" defined that ecosystem
* **PvE vs PvP Mentality** - Many observers note that HyperEVM fosters collaboration rather than competition, with holders supporting projects long-term

#### The Two Ecosystems

Hyperliquid's token scene has evolved into two distinct but connected spheres:

**HyperCore (Order Book)**

* **$PURR** - One of the first native memecoins
* **$PIP** - Considered a blue chip memecoin by orderbook traders
* **$HFUN** - Early memecoin on HyperCore

**HyperEVM (Smart Contract)**

* **$BUDDY** - First major memecoin on HyperEVM, known for its "Alright buddy" catchphrase
* **$RUB** - Unique token with "reverse unit bias" and non-traditional naming
* **$EVM** and **$LUBE** - Additional tokens in the ecosystem

### Notable Projects

#### $BUDDY

$BUDDY stands out as the pioneering memecoin on HyperEVM, with several key attributes:

* First coin to spark the HyperEVM memecoin movement
* Strong holder community that continues to support the project
* "Alright buddy" has become a cultural catch phrase within the ecosystem
* Remarkable resilience despite 73% of supply being airdropped to community

#### $RUB

$RUB offers a fresh narrative in the memecoin space:

* Breaks away from traditional animal-based memes (no dogs, cats, or frogs)
* Features an unusual price display (appears as high dollar amounts)
* Distribution primarily to active Hyperliquid users
* Potential to attract traders from other chains seeking new narratives

### The Hypio Connection

The Hypio NFT collection has become deeply intertwined with Hyperliquid's memecoin scene:

* Original mint price of $50 has provided holders with multiple airdrops
* Returns exceeding 200x within months through airdrops of $BUDDY, $RUB, $EVM and more
* Continues to be a major distribution vector for new tokens

### Community Dynamics

The Hyperliquid memecoin space shows interesting social patterns:

* Strong holder mentality compared to other chains where quick selling is common
* Community-driven support of specific winners ($BUDDY and $RUB emerging as favorites)
* Potential tensions between HyperCore and HyperEVM communities, with different preferences and investment strategies
* Likely to be further incentivized in future Hyperliquid points seasons

### Outlook

As the ecosystem matures, several trends are worth watching:

* The potential for a Hyperliquid equivalent to what $BONK became for Solana
* Increased mainstream attention as the ecosystem grows
* More airdrops anticipated for active community members
* Growing integration between HyperCore and HyperEVM token economies
