# MemeCoin

Dive into the trenches of the HyperLiquid ecosystem with memecoins and tokens that drive community engagement.

### The Hyperliquid Memecoin Phenomenon

Hyperliquid's memecoin scene is emerging as a unique ecosystem with characteristics that differentiate it from other blockchain environments:

#### Community-First Culture

Unlike many other chains where memecoins quickly rise and fall, Hyperliquid has developed a more supportive community culture that shapes both current dynamics and future potential:

* **Hypios as a Movement** - The "Hypio" community identity has become a cultural touchpoint, similar to how "Solana Degens" defined that ecosystem
  * [Hypio NFT collection](https://drip.trade/collections/hypio) has become deeply intertwined with Hyperliquid's memecoin scene
  * Original mint price of $50 has provided holders with multiple airdrops ($BUDDY, $RUB, $EVM)
  * Returns exceeding **200x within months** demonstrate the power of community-first distribution
  * Continues serving as a major distribution vector for new tokens
* **PvE vs PvP Mentality** - Many observers note that Hyperliquid fosters collaboration rather than competition, with holders supporting projects long-term
  * **Community-driven support** of specific winners ($BUDDY and $RUB emerging as favorites)
  * **Cross-ecosystem dynamics** create interesting tensions between HyperCore and HyperEVM communities with different investment strategies
  * **Future incentives** through Hyperliquid points seasons likely to strengthen this collaborative approach
* **Ecosystem Evolution** - As the space matures, several key trends are emerging:
  * Potential for a **"$BONK moment"** - a defining memecoin that becomes Hyperliquid's flagship
  * Growing **mainstream attention** as the ecosystem scales and differentiates itself
  * Enhanced **cross-chain appeal** attracting traders seeking alternatives to solana memes

#### The Two Ecosystems

Hyperliquid's token scene has evolved into two distinct but connected spheres:

* **HyperCore (Order Book)** - The original Hyperliquid trading environment hosts several established tokens:
  * **$PURR** - One of the first native memecoins
  * **$PIP** - Considered a blue chip memecoin by orderbook traders
  * **$HFUN** - Early memecoin on HyperCore
  * For a comprehensive overview of all HyperCore tokens, see this [notion](https://0xpasteke.notion.site/68a1348a53c14e6fbd405036128037f5?v=26e777a949c34b6090b888ed20627295) by @0xPasteke
* **HyperEVM (Smart Contract)**
  * **$BUDDY** - The pioneer that sparked the HyperEVM memecoin movement:
    * First major memecoin on HyperEVM with strong cultural impact
    * **"Alright buddy"** catchphrase became ecosystem staple
    * Remarkable community resilience despite 73% supply airdropped
    * Continues to maintain strong holder support
  * **$RUB** - Breaking traditional memecoin narratives:
    * **Unique positioning** - No dogs, cats, or frogs; fresh narrative approach
    * **Reverse unit bias** - Displays as high dollar amounts with unusual pricing
    * Primarily distributed to active Hyperliquid users
    * Attracting traders seeking alternatives to traditional animal memes
  * **Additional Tokens** - **$EVM** and **$LUBE** - Growing presence in the ecosystem

### HypurrNFTs

A premium NFT collection distributed to Hyperliquid's most dedicated early supporters, representing the ultimate status symbol within the ecosystem:

**Exclusivity & Scarcity**

* Only **\~5,500 NFTs** will ever exist, awarded to top 5,000 points holders during TGE
* Each piece is uniquely individual - not just another profile picture, but a personalized representation of early ecosystem participation

**Market Dynamics**

* Historical sales include multiple **$30,000+ transactions** on secondary market.
* Collection market cap of [$166.5M](https://x.com/Keisan_Crypto/status/1921583264034099381) positions it near tier-1 collections like BAYC and Pudgy Penguins
* Secondary market managed by [Kirby](https://x.com/kirbyongeo) in the [HypurrCO & Frens](https://t.me/+kQPx4WNpHEk4MmRl) OTC channel

**Strategic Value**

* **Airdrop magnet** - Prime target for ecosystem protocol airdrops as new projects TGE throughout the year
* **Anti-VC symbol** - Represents rebellion against traditional venture capital dominance in crypto
* **Wealth retention** - Top holders already enriched by $HYPE don't need liquidity, creating supply scarcity
* **Future utility** - Potential for embedded value additions by Hyperliquid team (speculative)
