### **Why Build on HyperLiquid?**

HyperLiquid offers a unique opportunity for developers by combining two execution environments under the same consensus algorithm:

1. **HyperLiquid's Rust VM** â€“ This onchain exchange powers **Perps, Spot, and Vaults**, providing unmatched liquidity and performance.
2. **HyperEVM** â€“ Designed for building **all types** of decentralized applications (Dapps). It **benefits** from HyperLiquid's existing **liquidity**, **user base**, and **distribution**, making it an ideal environment for teams to launch their projects.

**Top Opportunities for Builders**

HyperLiquidâ€™s community and ecosystem create specific advantages for various DeFi and governance applications:

* **Liquid Staking** â€“ HyperLiquid's PoS chain needs a token for validation. A liquid staking service for its loyal user base could become the fastest-growing protocol.
* **Perps Traders and Market Makers** â€“ Leverage HyperLiquidâ€™s liquidity for options AMMs, prediction markets, and cross-collateral margin solutions.
* **HLP Holders** â€“ The TVL in HLP vaults offers opportunities for tokenization, secondary liquidity, and yield trading. Build leverage vaults or complex DeFi strategies tailored to HLP users.
* **Spot Traders** â€“ With the spot ecosystem growing, new tools such as spot leverage and governance/vesting solutions will enhance user experience and market efficiency.
