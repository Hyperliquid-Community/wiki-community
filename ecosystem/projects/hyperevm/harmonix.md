### The Vision

After FTX's collapse, Harmonix emerged with a clear mission: build a **decentralized hedge fund** where users maintain full control while accessing institutional-grade strategies. Unlike Alameda which extracted value, Harmonix reinforces the ecosystem it operates in.

Founded by **Frank Dang** (6 years investment banking, built $50M TVL aggregator) and **Bean Nguyen** (10 years in tech, quantitative model developer), the team brings traditional finance expertise to DeFi innovation. Starting in 2020 with quantitative models for Bean's Singapore team, they evolved to pioneer the Option Wheel strategy on Deribit in 2022 before focusing on Hyperliquid.

**Core principle**: Every dollar deposited strengthens Hyperliquid's liquidity infrastructure while generating sustainable yield for users.

### Core Products

#### USDC-HYPE Delta Neutral Vault (Live on HyperCore)

The flagship vault delivering **8-15% APY** on stablecoins - one of the highest sustainable yields in DeFi.

* **What is Delta-Neutral?** A strategy that earns yield without betting on price direction. You're **market neutral** - making money whether prices go up or down through funding rate capture.
* **How your money works:** • Deposit USDC → Strategy buys spot HYPE + opens equal short position • Earn from positive funding rates (longs pay shorts) • Withdraw anytime with your principal + accumulated yield
* **Real costs to consider:** • Entry: \~0.08% (trading fees + slippage) • Performance fee: 10% on profits only • **Key insight**: Stay deposited at least 2 weeks to offset entry costs

#### $HYPE Vault on HyperEVM (Launching July 2025)

The next evolution: deposit HYPE, receive **haHYPE** - a yield-bearing token that grows in value automatically.

**The delta-neutral strategy in action:**

1. You deposit 100 HYPE
2. Vault uses HYPE as collateral on Felix Protocol to borrow feUSD
3. Converts feUSD → USDC for the hedging strategy
4. Capital splits for perfect balance:
   * **50% shorts HYPE** on HyperCore (earning funding rates)
   * **50% buys back HYPE** for deployment in HyperEVM DeFi
5. Result: Zero price exposure, pure yield generation

**What you earn:**&#x20;

* **Funding rate yield**: 10-15% APR from the short position
* **DeFi protocol yields**: From staking and liquidity provision across HyperEVM&#x20;
* **Arbitrage opportunities**: feUSD ↔ USDC price differences captured automatically
* **Felix liquidation bonuses**: Additional HYPE rewards when prices decline
* **Ecosystem points**: Felix, Harmonix, and partner protocol rewards
* **Future haHYPE strategies**: Additional yield from looping mechanisms

**Fees (only charged at withdrawal):** • Management: 1% annually (pro-rated) • Performance: 10% on net profits • **Key insight**: Stay at least 7 days to ensure yield covers fees

#### Understanding haHYPE (Yield-Bearing Token)

When you deposit into the HYPE vault, you receive haHYPE - think of it as a **receipt that grows in value**.

**Key benefits for users:**

* **Auto-compounding**: No need to claim or restake - value increases automatically (your haHYPE balance stays the same)
* **Transferable**: Send to friends, trade on DEXs, or use in other protocols&#x20;
* **Collateral potential**: Soon usable for borrowing across HyperEVM
* **Flexible withdrawals**: Request anytime (processing time 1-3 days)

**Planned integrations:** • Liquidity pools on Hyperswap (haHYPE/HYPE pairs) • Borrowing markets on Timeswap and Hyperlend • Yield tokenization on Napier Finance

### The Bottom Line

Harmonix creates a **liquidity loop** where user profits strengthen Hyperliquid:

* Every deposit increases open interest on HyperCore
* Strategies deepen liquidity across Felix, Hyperlend, and Hyperswap
* YBTs like haHYPE become shared collateral reducing bridged asset dependency
* Result: Sustainable yields that compound within the ecosystem

**The endgame**: Liquidity that works for users AND the protocol - positioned to win through alignment, not extraction.
